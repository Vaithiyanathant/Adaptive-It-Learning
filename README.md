<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
<p>
  -Identification: The project addresses the challenge of ineffective IT training by introducing an 
AI-based system that adapts courses to individual learning styles, improving efficiency and skill 
development. This innovation ensures a personalized and streamlined learning experience for IT 
professionals.
- Significance: It's crucial to solve this problem because current IT training methods don't 
consider that everyone learns differently. This leads to wasted time and resources. By making 
IT training personalized with our solution, we can help people learn more efficiently, saving 
time and making sure they gain the skills they need

<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
<p>
  - Description: Our solution is to create a smart IT training system that uses computer smarts
to understand how each person learns. Instead of everyone learning the same way, our system 
figures out the best way for each person. This makes IT training more effective and helps each 
person learn at their own pace.
