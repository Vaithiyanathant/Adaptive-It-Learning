<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>

  - Description: Our solution is to create a smart IT training system that uses computer smarts
to understand how each person learns. Instead of everyone learning the same way, our system 
figures out the best way for each person. This makes IT training more effective and helps each 
person learn at their own pace.
